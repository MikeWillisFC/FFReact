checkout:
- full review
- OSEL: browser address autofill is not detected, fields appear to be empty
- OSEL + OPAY: the OSEL page saves the basket to local storage / cookie (using the store plugin). If
--- the basket is not available on OPAY, it crashes. We need a fallback in this scenario, not a crash
- OSEL: the form is slow and laggy due to re-renders when typing. Must fix this

- XXXX do it
- XXXX autocomplete terms
- XXXX if search is product code, return set of like-items
- XXXX ProductList: router.push( url, url, { shallow: true });
--- this line will remove things like gclid from the query string. Will Google still
--- track the click? Perhaps best to skip this line on first render, and only run it
--- on future renders somehow...
